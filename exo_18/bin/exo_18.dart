/*
 * As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board.
 * For now, we will simply focus on checking whether someone has WON the game, 
 * not worrying about how the moves were made.

 * If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:

 * game = [[1, 2, 0],
 *        [2, 1, 0],
 *        [2, 1, 1]]
 * where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token 
 * in that space, and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.

 * Your task: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, 
 * tell whether anyone has won, and tell which player won, if any.

 * A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column, or a diagonal. 
 * Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be one winner.
